# Dance-Arcade
A machine learning game where the object detection model detects human feet at a constant pace while musi plays in the background.

# Repository Struture

Main branch consists all files required to run the project.

Remaining branches consist of code to either train various models considered for the project or the code create data set for training and validation of models.

# SETTING UP OF PROJECT ON LOCAL SYSTEM

# Step 1: 
 Clone the project from git and make sure all the music files and other folders are in the same folder
 
 The project uses a few pictures a music files so keep them in the same folder
